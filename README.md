# ArchiCloudNetï¼šAn Integrated Dataset of Professional Architectural Images and 3D Point
This dataset includes three categories of professional architectural images, each paired with 3D architectural point cloud data. These images, sourced from the architectural design process, come with specific camera parameters and are categorized into line drawings, shadowed block diagrams, and architectural renderings.

 Origin: 
 
Our unique dataset emphasizes architectural forms, drawing from 4689 SketchUp models. These designs, provided by 131 architecture students (96 undergraduates and 35 postgraduates), offer a glimpse into the diverse world of architectural forms. Each model has been meticulously transformed into normalized point cloud data, making them suitable for advanced algorithmic and model use.
 Composition and Features:
 
The dataset comprises three key types of images from architectural design, each paired with point cloud data (with camera parameters and masks): line drawings, shadowed block diagrams, and architectural visuals. These images reflect the progression in design, from initial sketches and drafts to detailed visuals. The choice of these categories ensures a comprehensive representation of the architectural design process and the potential transition from 2D to 3D.

Dataset Highlights:

Quality Assurance: The designs originate from architecture students who receive expert feedback during their design phase. This process ensures each entry has undergone rigorous review, guaranteeing top-notch data quality.

Diversity within Uniformity: Our dataset aggregates designs from 131 students, all tailored for a consistent rectangular plot. Despite this uniform constraint, the dataset showcases a plethora of styles and ideas, thanks to the individual creativity of each student.

Detailed Perspectives: Highlighting the 3D essence of the designs, we've captured multiple perspectives of each architectural model, emphasizing the thorough documentation of camera parameters.
